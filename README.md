# Interview Scheduler

  Interview Scheduler is a booking app that allows students to book interview sessions with a mentor Monday through Friday 12pm-5pm. The app is able to handle bookings, along with cancellations, that get updated in real time with a daily interview spot counter on the side bar for each day. A student is not only able to book a interview with their perfered interviewer, but also edit & delete them as well.

  Interview Scheduler was built through React and uses PostgreSQL as the interview database. The app and database are connected through a Websocket server which get updated through axios HTTP requests.
